CreatorLib
==========

This Library is there to help me in my Android projects.

The task of creating a great Android app involves creating a code design flow or structure of the app. When we're newbies we don't care about that much. But as soon as we start getting our hands dirty with complicated scenarios, we started understanding the value of a proper app structure.

This library is included in almost all of my Android eclipse projects with some modifications. I am going to make this more generic and continue to update it with latest changes.

Thanks.
